    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
        Alexander's most recent works investigate the narratives and ranges of emotions that can potentially be experienced during the confines of a romantic affair.<br>
        These issues are expressed through (but not limited to) large oil paintings and drawings.<br>
        These medium allows him to have complete control of how the image is constructed and how the content is perceived,
        which leaves a lot of room for ambiguity and androgyny.<br>
        The landscape is used a metaphor to set the stage for these emotionally charged situations while the figures are enveloped within it.<br>
        These paintings are created so personal nostalgic events can be re-experienced in a more beautiful way regardless of how untruthful or exaggerated the image ultimately is.<br>-<br>

Born in 1993 in Dayton, Ohio. Alexander is an undergrad at the Maryland Institute College of Art soon to complete his BFA in Painting.
